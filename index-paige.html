    My project is documenting life in quarantine, isolating yourself from the real, organic world and setting yourself up in your home office.

    One of the many things that were challenging during these crazy times, was the poor internet connection that I had to deal with over lockdown.

    COVID-19 prevented us from having gatherings and spending time together. I also documented activities that we missed out on during lockdown.

    I wanted to express this through something I enjoy doing. Turning the real world into a virtual world using digital technology, but was hampered by the lack of internet connectivity.

    However, I used this problem to my advantage by experimenting and expanding my knowledge of CSS animation.

    I took a visually interesting landscape, focused on the structure or basic movement involved, and transitioned it into the virtual world of code using the glitch of bad internet connections.
