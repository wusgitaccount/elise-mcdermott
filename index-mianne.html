    Inspired by the Ancient Greeks and their history, I designed a publication exploring a specific facet of their culture,  Ancient Greek Pottery. I discovered my old high school classics textbooks at home, and decided to take a similar approach in designing a guidebook of sorts, that loosely parodies this style. For the second part of my project, I wanted to emphasize important parts/information from my research. I decided to create a series of three posters, which highlight key pages within the publication. The posters highlight the two important painting styles, and one poster explores the most important historical vase.
