    Vogue Advertisements throughout the years 1892-2018 <br>

    This project is centered around the gathering of and documenting of advertisements from Vogue throughout the years of 1892 - 2018 with the intention of being able to see the shift in trends and styles over the 126 years. This work is a visual language timeline consisting of 39 different posters and a publication which investigates and documents my research.
    <br><br>
    The A2 posters are used as a mode for documenting the advertisements over a period of time. The extractions of advertisements from Vogue Magazine’s online archive create a visual language timeline showing the trends and manner Vogue presents each year.
    <br><br>
    As a larger point of reference and research for the posters I also created a publication (15.5 x 21) which poses as an archive that catalogues the covers and advertisements I have used in my posters. The publication draws together the images into one catalogue to clearly show my process of how I created the posters and is a way of referencing the content and style used. Therefore, creating another form of a timeline to show how Vogue’s style has changed with each decade.
