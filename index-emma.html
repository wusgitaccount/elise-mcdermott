          The Juicy Publication was designed with
      the final format of print publication from
      the start. It was born from a simple idea to
      represent the topic of ‘Fruits’ in unique and
      refreshing perspective. The broad idea then
      developed more into focusing around the
      visual relationship between fruits and the
      human body. The designs play around with
      fluid, bodily elements and fruity colours. The
      process of taking photographs for Bodily Fruits
      and PEEL allowed me to experiment with
      the flexible aspect and the organic shapes
      of fruits. Most of compostions were heavily
      influenced by fine art catalogues and print
      materials.<br><br>
      During the process of printing the final
      product, I’ve decided to print the first
      three chapters on uncoated paper as it
      complements the visual quality of the images
      in those chapters and the last chapter ‘PEEL’
      on coated paper in order to mimic the gloss
      and shine from the cocktails. The colours of
      the posters corresponds with the bookmarks
      in the ‘Fruity Music Videos’ chapter. The
      bookmarks gives a pop of colours to the clean
      black exterior of the book as much like the
      visual order of the content of the book; moving
      from dark black pages to more bright and
      colourful pages.
