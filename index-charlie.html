    My project is centered around weaving — with a focus on the ways in which the textures of our culture are mirrored by the patterns we produce and how they create cultural connections and tell our stories. Visually and verbally exploring the fibers we use and how the act of weaving connects us to our whakapapa and whenua.
    <br> <br>
    Through my research I found most of us are deeply connected to textile craft, as it has been passed down through maternal bloodlines.
    <br> <br>
    For one of my publications, I documented my exploration into naturally dyeing New Zealand wool with locally found plants. My second publication includes conversations with local weavers and how they engage with  the craft.
    <br> <br>
    Alongside my publications, I hosted a weaving workshop on Karangahape Road treasure — Samoa House Library, the event was open to all. Its aims were to weave together not only threads, but conversation and meaningful connection within a community. For this I designed posters for the event, handouts for everyone attending and documentation of the event itself. This was in collaboration with local charity, Auckland Action Against Poverty, who received any monetary donations.
