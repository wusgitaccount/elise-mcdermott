    Formata pulls characteristics from both traditional calligraphy and digital illustration, using a calligraphic fountain pen, with letterforms drawn at a consistent 45degree angle. The creation of the typeface involved many reinditions of each glyph. In an obsessive development to forge the ideal letterforms, I came to understanding that the far more captivating outcome was the process and iterations themselves. As a result, I have curated a typeface of 500 letterforms, each contributing to Formata as a whole.
    <br><br>
    My initial interest in creating a blackletter comes from my Semester 1 research into black metal culture, music and art. Black metal aesthetics thrive on the concept of the underground, willful withdrawal from the world, and subsequently an outsider mindset. This is expressed aurally through the music itself in harsh and discordant noise, and visually through outsider art and anachronistic, intimidating type.
    <br><br>
    In my practice as a musician, I wrote a black metal album named Parhelia between 2019 and 2020. In the process of writing Parhelia, my goal was to achieve balance between authenticity, following in the form of influences, and finding my avenue of creative expression. The result is that Parhelia exist in between, acting as vessel for emotional articulatio, and simultaniously as a reverence to its influences and inspirations.
    <br><br>
    Formata acts as an accompanying visual representation for Parhelia, and occupies the same liminal space, existing between tradition and creative expressions, while fitting neither categorisation. Formata exists as a vessel for the misfit.
