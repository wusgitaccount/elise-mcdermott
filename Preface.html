                  <p> The work of New Zealand artist, Elise McDermott, is an exploration of unassuming materials and substances found in
            urban environments. She reworks materials in a way that emphasises their value within form; objects that are usually
            discarded when they don’t serve their practical purpose any longer. In addition, she also uses colour as a tool to incite a
            sense of connection between the work and the viewer. A past experience or idea is shaped by the materials, objects,
            and surfaces within it, re-composing them into a two-dimensional area or three-dimensional space helps to bring the
            viewer’s emotional reaction to the work into question. </p>
                  <p> Elise’s installation and sculpture methods include the use of various found objects or construction materials including
            wood, metals, plaster, paint and household pieces. Meanwhile, her digital artworks are comprised of real-life imagery
            and painterly linework. She often finds inspiration in historical archives and settings in her surrounding area </p>
