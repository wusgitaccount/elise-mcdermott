    My body of work titled Consumption Programme revolves around the idea of addiction and consumerism, and
    is a series of 4 A1 posters and 1 A5 publication. I’ve mainly followed the process of constantly collecting loyalty
    stamp cards and making scans of each one. The style of my project is in full black and white and involves a lot of
    collaging methods as I’ve intended this body of work to capture a very inky, rustic feel. Local cafés and
    restaurants that attract and build brand loyalty with customers by using these stamp cards is the field that I have
    researched on; this is further shown in the mini publication that includes articles on daily food/drink
    consumption and the strategy of the loyalty card.
