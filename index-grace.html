          Digital Beach is a website and poster that is a digital interpretation of a place called Karioitahi Beach, located in South Auckland, where I spent my lockdown. I looked at my daily routine and going to the beach every day is what came up the most, as I’m interested in digital landscape and incorporating online and offline environments. I explored Karioitahi Beach and proceeded to use the materials from the beach like shells and water photos. I started by collecting shells every day.  I incorporate scanology and printing techniques too. I also put Indian ink on shells and proceeded to stamp them on paper to see what negative and positive shapes they would make. This is similar to the artist Catherine Griffiths “You Will Need Both Hands to Walk”, Paul Elliman works with typography and Sian Aldridge who works with scanology. While standing at the beach, ideas that I explored that came to mind were movements on the beach like water, the sunset and shells washing up onto shore, it had a certain look and feel to it as the sand and tide were forming round the shells. This got me thinking about how the shells were laid on the ground and how I could turn this into a digital website.
