    Bridging Victoria & River: A Print Project <br>

    “Now, more than simply ignoring production quality and denying technique, paradoxically many designers are fetishizing the use of low quality printing in a way that we hadnt anticipated. This is somehow now the image quality of the risograph printer has made a sneaky shift from signifying ‘church flyer’ to ‘critical design’.”
    -National Grid, Jonty Valentine
    <br><br>
    The risograph duplicator is used to explore this idea through the colloquial iconography of Hamilton, New Zealand.
    The Fairfield Bridge, which crosses the Waikato River and links Victoria Street on the West bank to River Road on the East Bank prompted the visual investigation into Hamilton as a recognisable structure and acted as a metaphor to bridge the idea of low quality print and critical graphic design.
    <br><br>
    “The proliferation of printed design/art publishing has resulted in stores of intentionally formally unsophisticated, low-resolution texts produced for an under-ground, in-between, speak easy community”
    -National Grid Continued.
    <br><br>
    Applying this idea to Hamilton through the iconography used highlights the varying sub-cultures of Hamilton and the wider Waikato region.

    Twelve Hamilton Houses <br>
    170x240mm<br>
    Publication <br> <br>
    Twelve Hamilton Houses explores the vernacular domestic typography of the twelve family houses that I lived in growing up in Hamilton, New Zealand. Documented via print, mainly the risograph stencil duplicator, local street signs and letterboxes are documented and extracted from images to to put each house and suburb up for comparison. Alongside the vernacular typography, the book examines other methods of displaying residential street addresses through multiple “mapping lenses” such as online Streetview, written, oral / folklore and more “traditional” modes of documenting “place”.

    The Perry Line<br>
    210x280mm<br>
    Publication; Typeface <br> <br>
    ‘The Perry Line’ is an archive of genealogy and family history that documents the ways in which information and stories are preserved over time. The book also includes links to wider social and political events that help to anchor the content within a broader historic context.

    The typeface “Dulcie” was designed for the purpose of being used within the publication. Dulcie was inspired by the music score sheets of Nola Dulcie Perry, my great grandmother. I have fond memories of family Christmas’s when she would open the piano and begin to play for anyone and everyone who would listen. Sadly, Nola passed away in 2013 but all her music and pieces she had collected over the years were passed down to her daughter. In the process of researching my own family history for this project I came across the score sheets in storage. I was fascinated by the typeface on one of her favorite songs HAERE MAI. Recreating and digitizing the typeface was my goal for this project. Studying the unique and quirky features of this serif font helped me better understand the process of making a typeface and the level of detail involved. The final typeface is named Dulcie in recognition to my great grandmother, the source of inspiration. The typeface is only in uppercase to be accurate to the original where necessary.
    <br> <br>
    The intention of this book was to document the array of research that was discovered during this process and to display how documents are preserved and have evolved over time. The final result is a 470 page book that has an exposed stitched binding with an embossed hard front and back cover.
