    Mandragora Officinarum<br>
    170x297mm<br>
    Publication<br><br>
    For my first publication I have designed a book informing the reader of botanical history, and how to care for each type of plant. The book is called ‘Mandragora Officinarum’, which is a scientific name for mandrake root. I figured this would be a perfect name for the book as it’s the name of a song ‘Mandrake Root, by Deep Purple’ that originally inspired me to begin a botanical book. During my research I was inspired by ancient botanical textbooks from the Medieval ages.

    Smile <br>
    230x297mm<br>
    Publication<br><br>
    My second publication is called ‘Smile’. The themes revolve around shopping malls, consumerism and CCTV footage. The title is a play on “Smile, You’re On Camera” surveillance signs found in public places and shopping malls. The book makes us question if traditional shopping is really dead, and if online shopping has taken over the majority. During my research I’ve been looking at Metahaven and the NZ artist Simon Denny.
    <br><br>
    Both books are wire bound which is the best choice for ‘Mandragora Officiarum’ because you can have the book spread open while planting/taking care of your plants without having to hold it open.
