    Isolation <br>
    110x180mm<br>
    Publication

    2020 has bought many new experiences, but an almost ubiquitous, globally shared experience is rare. Globally, 128 countries and territories have mandated 8010 days in lockdown as of November. I’ve used The COVID-19 lockdown experience as an opportunity to explore what isolation can mean to different people viewed through different artistic lenses. I researched literature, photography, poetry and theory that resonated with the experience of isolation and bound it together in a format akin to a handbook as if it’s to be something to carry with you and refer to.  The philosophy around isolation is inherently linked to our sense of self, as we define ourselves in the context of those around us. Isolation physically, emotionally and spiritually are all different experiences, but lend themselves to nihilism and a sense of absurdism.

    Road Trip Rules<br>
    148x210mm<br>
    Series of foldout posters<br><br>
    The New Zealand road trip is a core childhood memory too many Kiwis, halcyon days in the back of a hot car on a windy road. I’ve always taken access to international travel for granted, and being restricted New Zealand for an undefined period of time has made me examine the cultural institution of the Kiwi road trip as it becomes the best option.  Road trips are often used as a literary device, examining a story as a journey.
    <br>I referenced the almost defunct format of a fold out map to examine he experience of the Kiwi road trip and referenced guide books from the 1970s, the golden age of road trips before airline travel was widely accessible, to examine how to create a memorable Kiwi road trip.
