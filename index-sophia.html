          Many first-generation migrants have grown up now, creating conversation around identity and culture when surrounded by two vastly different environments.
      In 1987, New Zealand Parliament passed a new Immigration Act which introduced a point-based system that classified migrants on their potential contribution to the country's society and economy. The policy change eliminated the preference for migrants from European countries and overemphasis on ethnicity/nationality. Regardless of race or nationality, any person who met specific educational, business, professional, age or asset requirements was to be admitted. This act came into effect in 1991.
      <br><br>
      	My parents scored 28 points following this point-based system and moved here in 1995. They were one of many families who moved to New Zealand during 1991-1995 while the act was in place. Like many migrant families, we kept all bureaucratic documents and letters from Immigration New Zealand. These date back to more than 25 years ago when my parents first applied to move here.
      These documents compelled me to explore ideas surrounding the migrant experience via print and publication, using the original artefacts and their visual forms.
