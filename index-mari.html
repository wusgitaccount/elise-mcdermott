    Summer Utopia<br>

    Publication<br><br>
    841x1189mm<br>
    Poster series<br><br>
        In my project I explored the idea of vision and reflection. By doing this I visualised the use of mirrors and how objects/ideas can be
    seen differently through different angles, which was inspired by the book Ways of Seeing by John Burgess. He made many statements
    that inspired me to work on a project surrounding visual interpretations of a dream world. I used mirrors as a guiding concept within my
    project.<br><br>
    I wanted it to be a series that included a publication, posters and animation.<br><br>
    I started by creating a mood board and art direction on what I envisioned the images to look like. I collaborated with a film photographer,
    Aislyn Stevens, who used a film camera to take the images while I also took digital images to compare the two outcomes. I ended up
    using a mix of both film and digital photographs to create my publication and designs.<br><br>
    Publication as a result it was interesting to look at the juxtaposition of analogue and digital photography. I think using both and contrasting between the two was a succesful result. I noticed the colours and texture differ between the images and it was fun to experiment
    combining the two with my collages.<br><br>
    Posters I wanted to explore mixed media, so I created these images by printing the photgraphs as a3 prints and then by using paint and
    glitter, I distorted the images by ripping up the images and scanned them through and finally blew it up to an a0 size to print.<br><br>
    Animation Using After effects and Photoshop I created animations with the collages I created to compliment my work.
